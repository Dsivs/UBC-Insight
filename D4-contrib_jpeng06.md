# retrospective 

The entried project was started late. Wasted a lot of time in the beginning of first two weeks. Fortunately, the project was 
able to be finished by the 
deadline. Some D4 checklists were implicit, hope we could have a much more specific and detailed spec. 

TA is no longer helpful and starts ignoring posts on Piazza. Limited TA was involved in discussion on Piazza (only 2 ish?), which leads hugh confusion and frustration at the 
beginning of this project before D4 tutorial was held. 

Also, whether or not this deliverable should be heavily depended on materials that are neither prerequisite of this course nor class materials is arguable and questionable.
