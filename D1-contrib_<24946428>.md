[performQuery done](https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team78/commit/b1e46473bb17667a1191a04744e26f822c7d590b)


[working finally](https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team78/commit/9521e7d7b1491513409b1c76acef4e9e57d194e7)


Got a bit lazy with performQuery at the beginning so I used an incredibly inefficient algorithm that exceeded heap limit.
Had to rewrite it entirely which turned out to not be as annoying as I thought it would be and managed to astronomically
improve runtimes (20s -> 12ms on large data sets). Probably should've consulted with instructors earlier regarding why autotest
was rejecting our code.
