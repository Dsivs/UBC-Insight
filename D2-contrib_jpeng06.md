#retrospective
Html parser is quite challenging at the beginning since documentation for parse5 is not quite clear. But once I got it working,
parse5 is quite handy. Since we got 100% for D1, D2 barely takes lot of work comparing to previous deliverables. Some functions
was reused for room and some functions barely changed after D2.
